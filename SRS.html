    <p><strong>Project:</strong> Mridulashray Web Platform</p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 22 Dec 2025</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      This document captures the functional and non-functional requirements for the Mridulashray web platform. It is intended for stakeholders, designers, and
      developers who maintain the marketing site, public engagement flows, and the Appwrite-backed admin console.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Scope</h3>
    <p>
      The system is a responsive, multi-page website highlighting Mridulashray’s programs, collecting volunteer/contact submissions, showcasing events, and providing
      an Appwrite-administered CMS for events, volunteers, and contacts. Public pages are built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, while authenticated operations rely on
      Appwrite services for authentication, database, and storage.
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Appwrite</strong> – Backend-as-a-service providing authentication, database, and storage services.</li>
      <li><strong>Album</strong> – Event entry with metadata, media assets, and publication status.</li>
      <li><strong>Volunteer Form</strong> – Public form that posts to Appwrite collections with an email fallback.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4 References</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Marketing pages (Home, Volunteer, Events, Contact, Compliance, Terms, Payment)</li>
      <li>Volunteer onboarding flow</li>
      <li>Events gallery implementation</li>
      <li>Admin portal scripts (login and dashboard)</li>
      <li>Global styling definitions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.5 Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Section 2 summarizes the product context, Section 3 enumerates system features, Section 4 covers external interfaces, and Sections 5–7 describe non-functional
      needs, data, and future considerations.

      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Public Visitors</strong></td>
          <td>Prospective donors, volunteers, or community partners.</td>
          <td>Browse pages, submit forms, view published events.</td>

    </table>

    <h3>2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Frontend: Modern desktop/mobile browsers with ES6 support.</li>

    <h3>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No server-side rendering; all operations are client-driven.</li>
      <li>Appwrite SDK must load before dependent scripts such as login, dashboard, and events pages.</li>
      <li>Anonymous public sessions required for read/write operations from public forms.</li>
      <li>Media uploads limited by Appwrite storage quotas and permissions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Appwrite credentials remain valid and are configured at deploy time.</li>
      <li>FormSubmit endpoint remains available as fallback for volunteer/contact submissions.</li>
      <li>Users possess stable internet connections for image-heavy galleries.</li>

    <h2>4. External Interface Requirements</h2>
    <h3>4.1 User Interface</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Consistent header/nav/footer across pages with responsive layout.</li>
      <li>Forms use labelled inputs, placeholders, and helper text to support accessibility.</li>
      <li>Admin dashboard uses tabbed sections, tables, and modals for media management; styling centralised in `styles.css`.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2 Hardware Interface</h3>
    <p>No dedicated hardware dependencies beyond standard user devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).</p>

    <h3>4.3 Software Interface</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Appwrite SDK:</strong> Loaded from CDN and used for authentication, database, and storage APIs.</li>
      <li><strong>FormSubmit:</strong> HTTP POST endpoint for email notifications when Appwrite persistence fails.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.4 Communications Interface</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>HTTPS requests to Appwrite endpoint for CRUD operations.</li>
      <li>Browser-native navigation and anchor scrolls for intra-page linking.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h2>5. Non-Functional Requirements</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Public pages must remain interactive under typical broadband/mobile connections; sliders and counters should initialize within 2 seconds after DOM ready. Events gallery should degrade gracefully when Appwrite is unavailable.</li>
      <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Appwrite collections should accommodate hundreds of events and thousands of volunteer/contact entries without code changes.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Security:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Enforce authenticated Appwrite sessions for admin dashboard actions.</li>
          <li>Use least-privilege permissions on uploaded files, granting read to public and edit/delete to uploader.</li>
          <li>Do not expose Appwrite API keys client-side; rely on project-level configuration.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Volunteer/contact submissions must either store in Appwrite or email fallback to avoid data loss.</li>
      <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Configuration centralized in `appwrite-config.js`; new collections/buckets must be added there and referenced in scripts.</li>
      <li><strong>Usability:</strong> Layouts must be responsive with accessible labels, alt text, and keyboard-supportive components (e.g., modal close buttons).</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />

    <h2>6. Data Requirements</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Entity</th>
          <th>Source Collection</th>
          <th>Key Fields</th>

          <td>`fileId`, `filename`, `type`, `uploadedAt`, `title`, `description`</td>
          <td>Permissions include public read and owner edit/delete.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>All date/time fields use ISO 8601 strings.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>7. Other Requirements</h2>
    <h3>7.1 Risk Assessment</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Appwrite Connectivity Failure:</strong> Mitigated via polling for SDK load and anonymous session retries.</li>
      <li><strong>Media Storage Limits:</strong> Need monitoring; deletion workflows remove associated storage files to conserve quotas.</li>
      <li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> `requireSession` and logout flows ensure only authenticated users operate the dashboard.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>7.2 Future Enhancements</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Implement server-side email notifications for new volunteer/contact submissions.</li>
      <li>Add pagination or search for large volunteer/contact datasets.</li>
      <li>Introduce role-based permissions for multi-admin setups.</li>
      <li>Provide analytics dashboards showing event engagement metrics.</li>
    </ol>
